# SMART-PARKING-SYSTEM
Smart Parking involves the use of low cost sensors, real-time data and applications that
allow users to monitor available and unavailable parking spots. The goal is to automate
and decrease time spent manually searching for the optimal parking floor, spot and
even lot. Some solutions will encompass a complete suite of services such as online
payments, parking time notifications and even car searching functionalities for very
large lots. A parking solution can greatly benefit both the user and the lot owner.
